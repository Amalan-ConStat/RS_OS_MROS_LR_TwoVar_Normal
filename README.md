### Real Model vs Assumed Model vs Model Free method for the Logistic Regression with Two variable where the covariate data is simulated from the Normal distribution.

A new model free method is compared with the existing OSMAC method under the circumstances where the initial sample size is same or otherwise for each simulation. 

To be brief, we simulate data from the real model and fit the data with the real model, assumed model and the model free method, and observe if the MSE of the model free method lies between the real and assumed model.

This setup is considered for the Logistic Regression over 1000 simulations for the two covariates scenario, where the models considered are main effect and main effect with squared component.
